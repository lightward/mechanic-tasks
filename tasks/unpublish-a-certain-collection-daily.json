  "docs": "Use this task with the companion publishing task (see this task's documentation) to make a certain collection of products available on a schedule, and unavailable on another schedule.\n\nFor best results, pair this task with [Publish a certain collection, daily](https://usemechanic.com/task/publish-a-certain-collection-daily), from our task library.\r\n\r\nTo configure this task, navigate to the collection you'd like to use in the Shopify admin. Copy _just_ the numeric portion from the URL (e.g. `12345`, if the collection URL is `https://example.myshopify.com/admin/collections/12345`), and use this as the \"Collection ID\" setting for this task.\r\n\r\nOut of the box, this task will unpublish everything in this collection at 6pm on weekdays, and 2pm on weekends. To adjust this, click the \"Show Advanced\" link, and tweak the \"Subscriptions\" setting to taste. Each line represents midnight in your shop's local timezone, plus whatever number of hours you prefer. For example, `mechanic/scheduler/tuesday+13.hours` would mean Tuesday at 1pm.",
