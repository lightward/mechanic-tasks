Refer to this [article](https://docs.usemechanic.com/article/360-how-do-i-find-an-id-for-a-product-collection-order-or-something-else) for assistance on finding Shopify object IDs.\n\nOut of the box, this task will unpublish everything in this collection at 6pm on weekdays, and 2pm on weekends. To adjust this, click the \"Show Advanced\" link, and tweak the \"Subscriptions\" setting to taste. Each line represents midnight in your shop's local timezone, plus whatever number of hours you prefer. For example, `mechanic/scheduler/tuesday+13.hours` would mean Tuesday at 1pm.",
