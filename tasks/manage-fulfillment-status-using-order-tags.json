  "docs": "Use this task to easily set the shipment status of your single-fulfillment orders. Just add a tag, and a new fulfillment event will be recorded, using the corresponding shipment status.\n\nThis task monitors order tags. For an order that has a single (non-cancelled) fulfillment, this task will update that fulfillment's shipment status according to the order's tags.\r\n\r\nThis task comes pre-configured with Shopify's shipment status identifiers on the right, and friendly order tags on the left. Feel free to update the tag names on the left-hand side. Do not modify the labels on the right! These must correspond directly to shipment statuses, as they're recorded by Shopify.\r\n\r\nFor a complete description of all Shopify shipment statuses, [see Shopify's \"shipment_status\" documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillment#shipment-status-property).",
