If an FSA is found that's not on a preconfigured list, this task sends an email to the recipients of your choice.\n\nThe FSA list must be comprised of FSAs in the format 'A1A', without the quotation marks. The FSAs must be separated by commas and no spaces. The FSAs can be entered in any order.\n\nThe task will log orders whose FSA was found in the available FSA list.\n\nIt also displays the available FSA list in json format to more easily catch if there were errors in inputting the availability list.
