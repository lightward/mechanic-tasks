  "docs": "Easily segment your orders by shipment status. Tagging your orders as \"Delivered\", or \"Out for delivery\", or \"Attempted delivery\", or any other status, allows you to stay on top of your order flow. And, adding these tags makes it easier to wire up additional automation, keeping the connection live between your customers and their orders.\n\nThis task monitors fulfillments for your orders. Whenever a fulfillment is updated, this task removes any shipment-related tags that might already be on the order, then adds whatever tag is relevant for the current shipment status. If there are multiple fulfillments for the order, and they have different statuses, this task will add more than one tag. (Naturally, if there are multiple fulfillments but they all have the same status, this task will only add one tag to the order.)\r\n\r\nThis task comes pre-configured with friendly tags, but feel free to update the tag names on the right-hand side. Do not modify the labels on the left! These correspond directly to shipment statuses as they're recorded by Shopify.\r\n\r\nFor a complete description of all Shopify shipment statuses, [see Shopify's \"shipment_status\" documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference/shipping-and-fulfillment/fulfillment#shipment-status-property).",
