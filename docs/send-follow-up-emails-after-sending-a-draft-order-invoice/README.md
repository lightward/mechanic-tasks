## Documentation

Use this task to send a follow-up email, 24 hours after you send out an email invoice for a draft order. Optionally, set this task to continue sending follow-up messages, every day after that.

After you send an invoice for a draft order, this task will send a follow-up email 24 hours later, reminding the customer on file to complete the order.

Please note: Because Shopify does not share information about the invoice you send, this task uses the email address of the customer on file for the order, _even if_ this is different than the email you use to send the invoice. If the draft order does _not_ have a customer on file, the task will not be able to send a follow-up.
