# Tag products by metaobject reference field values

Tags: Metaobjects, Products, Tag

Use this task to copy metaobject field values to the referencing products' tags. Configure a product metafield that is a *metaobject_reference* type (or *list.metaobject_reference*), and add the metaobject field keys which contain the values to be added as tags, along with paired tag prefixes for each. Then run the task manually, or schedule it to run daily, and it will scan all active products in the shop on each run and tag them as needed.

## Documentation

Use this task to copy metaobject field values to the referencing products' tags. Configure a product metafield that is a *metaobject_reference* type (or *list.metaobject_reference*), and add the metaobject field keys which contain the values to be added as tags, along with paired tag prefixes for each. Then run the task manually, or schedule it to run daily, and it will scan all active products in the shop on each run and tag them as needed.

First consider using "Test mode" to have the task log out which tagging decisions it would have made, before having it make live changes to your products.

*Tagging example*:

A metaobject for "Book Authors" has a **name** field defined that you wish to apply as tags to the book products in your shop. The book products have a metafield definition for **custom.book_authors** that references the metaobject's entries, allowing you to attach one or more authors to a book. Using a configured tag prefix of "author: ", this task might add product tags like: "author: Jean Deaux" and "author: Anon Y. Mous".

**Note:** Mechanic cannot access metafields controlled by other apps.
