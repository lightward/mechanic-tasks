## Documentation

Use this task to sell a single product in different pack sizes, keeping inventory levels synchronized appropriately, storing the "master" inventory level in a product tag (e.g. "inventory:50").

New orders for a pack-sized variant will result in the product's inventory tag being updated, and all pack-sized variants having their inventory levels re-synced. And, manually updating a product's inventory tag will automatically re-sync variant inventory levels as well.

The pack size for each variant can be determined by a numeric [product option](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/variants) (e.g. "Pack size: 50"), or by [metafield](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/metafields).

This task will skip any products that do not have an inventory tag, and will skip any variants ordered that have no pack size information.
