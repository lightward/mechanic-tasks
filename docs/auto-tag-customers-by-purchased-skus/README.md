# Auto-tag customers by purchased SKUs

Tags: Auto-Tag, Customers, SKU

Use this task to keep customers tagged with the SKUs of the products they've purchased, optionally ignoring product purchases that have been refunded. Add a tag prefix to make SKU tags easy to distinguish from your other customer tags. This task also stores all purchased SKUs in a customer metafield, dodging the 250 tag limit that exists for customers.

This task also records all purchased SKUs in a JSON metafield called "mechanic.purchased_skus", associated with the customer. For customers who have purchased more products than would fit inside Shopify's maximum tag limit of 250, this metafield provides a way for you to access _all_ purchased SKUs.
