## Documentation

This task demonstrates how to use the four Mechanic Shopify Flow triggers: General, Customer, Product, and Order.

You'll learn about the user-defined data that we can send to Shopify Flow: user_boolean, user_email, user_number, user_string, user_url.

We demonstrate subscribing to an event topic fired by a Shopify Flow action. You'll need to set up a workflow in the Shopify Flow app to trigger this event topic. This example could be in any Mechanic task; we have this as part of this task for demonstration purposes. The event topic can be anything in the user domain. We choose user/flow/customer (etc), but it could be something like user/flow/xyz.
