## Documentation

This task sends recurring unpaid order reminders to customers, emailing them on a configurable schedule, until the order is no longer "pending" or until the order is cancelled.

Use the variables ORDER_NUMBER, AMOUNT_DUE, and TAX_LINES to insert each of these values in to your email subject or body.

​To have the task _only_ email for fulfilled orders, set the "Limit to orders matching this query" option to "fulfillment_status:shipped".

Use test mode to have this task report what emails it _would_ send, if test mode were not enabled. It's a good idea to start with this. :)
