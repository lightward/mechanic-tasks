## Documentation

This task allows you to easily see which customers have open draft orders. Using the tag of your choice, it will set it on any customers with at least one open draft order (including draft orders where an invoice has been sent).

It runs on draft order creation and updates, as well as a daily scan of all customers with the tag or an open draft order. This daily run will handle the use cases of deleting a customer's only open draft order or switching the customer on a draft order. Run the task manually to run this same comprehensive scan.
