## Documentation

Use this this task to monitor for the addition of a new product tag, and to schedule the product to be untagged some number of days later. Useful for temporarily adding a product to a collection, or qualifying the product for some other temporary functionality.

This task monitors new and updated products, watching for the configured product tag.

As soon as that tag is detected, the task will _add_ a second tag, indicating that the product is scheduled to be untagged. (For example, if the task is configured to watch for the tag "Approved", the task will _add_ the tag "Approved - will be auto-removed by Mechanic".) The task will then schedule a followup event for the future, according to the configured number of days to wait. At that time, the task will remove both tags.

Important note: To _prevent_ the task from untagging the product later, manually remove the task's additional tag (i.e. the "will be auto-removed by Mechanic" tag). If the additional tag is found missing, the task will leave the tag in place instead of auto-removing it.
