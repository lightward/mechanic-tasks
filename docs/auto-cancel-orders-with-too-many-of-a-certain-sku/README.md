## Documentation

Useful for enforcing order limits on the backend, use this task to ensure that orders with too many of certain products will be automatically cancelled.

Configure the product SKUs to monitor on the left and the quantities that will trigger a cancellation on the right. Optionally, choose whether to email the customer, refund the payment, or restock the inventory upon cancellation. The configured cancellation reason must be one of - 'customer', 'declined', 'fraud', 'inventory', 'other', or 'staff'.

Notes:

* SKUs are case-sensitive!
* Any refunds generated by this task will be for the maximum amount, for the order being cancelled.
