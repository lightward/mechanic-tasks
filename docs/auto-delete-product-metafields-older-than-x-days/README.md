## Documentation

Use this task to auto-delete product metafields that are older than the configured minimum age in days. Useful for removing transient metafields a certain number of days after they have been created.

Enter one or more metafields using *namespace.key* format (e.g. "custom.new_arrival" ), and on the daily task run it will find and delete any matching product metafield which was **created at** prior to the cutoff date.

It is highly recommended to first run this task using the *Test mode* option, so it can log out which metafields have qualified for deletion without actually deleting them. Pair this with running the task manually to avoid waiting for the next scheduled task run to see the test mode logging.

**Note:**
The "cutoff date" uses the beginning of the task run day (i.e. midnight local shop time) as the start time to count backwards the configured minimum age in days.
