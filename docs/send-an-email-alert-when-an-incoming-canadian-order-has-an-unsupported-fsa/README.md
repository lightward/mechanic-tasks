# Send an email alert when an incoming Canadian order has an unsupported FSA

Tags: Alert, Delivery, Email, Shipping

Useful for Canadian stores with limited shipping zones, this task inspects [the FSA (the first three characters of the postal code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada#Forward_sortation_areas) for each order's shipping address. If an FSA is found that's not on a preconfigured list, this task sends an email to the recipients of your choice.

## Documentation

Useful for Canadian stores with limited shipping zones, this task inspects [the FSA (the first three characters of the postal code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Canada#Forward_sortation_areas) for each order's shipping address. If an FSA is found that's not on a preconfigured list, this task sends an email to the recipients of your choice.

The FSA list must be comprised of FSAs in the format 'A1A', without the quotation marks. The FSAs must be separated by commas and no spaces. The FSAs can be entered in any order.

The task will log orders whose FSA was found in the available FSA list.

It also displays the available FSA list in json format to more easily catch if there were errors in inputting the availability list.
