# Remind customers that their order is on the way

Do you ship custom items, or do you have a lengthy turnaround time on your orders? Use this task to automatically re-assure customers that their order is in the queue, to be shipped as soon as possible. By default, this task sends an email 10 days (or a number you configure) after the order is paid, as long as the order remains fully paid, unfulfilled, and un-cancelled. Optionally, configure tags to add to the order and/or customer, to be added when the email is sent, and choose whether to only send reminders on weekdays.

## Documentation

Do you ship custom items, or do you have a lengthy turnaround time on your orders? Use this task to automatically re-assure customers that their order is in the queue, to be shipped as soon as possible. By default, this task sends an email 10 days (or a number you configure) after the order is paid, as long as the order remains fully paid, unfulfilled, and un-cancelled. Optionally, configure tags to add to the order and/or customer, to be added when the email is sent, and choose whether to only send reminders on weekdays.

Use the variables ORDER_NUMBER and CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME to insert each of these values into your email subject and body respectively.

Note: When the "Only send reminders on weekdays" option is chosen, any emails that would have been sent on a weekend are instead emailed the following Monday.
