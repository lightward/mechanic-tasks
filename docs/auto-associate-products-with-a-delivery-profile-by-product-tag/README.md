## Documentation

Use this task to automatically add products, as they're tagged, to a specific delivery profile. Untag products to remove them from the configured profile.

Configure this task using a product tag to watch for, and a delivery profile ID. Find the delivery profile ID by navigating to the "Shipping and delivery" section of your Shopify admin area, and clicking on the "Manage rates" link of the delivery profile you want to use. The delivery profile ID is the series of numbers at the very end of the URL – if the URL is example.myshopify.com/admin/settings/shipping/profiles/12345, then the delivery profile ID is 123545.
