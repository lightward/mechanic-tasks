# Auto-tag products with their vendors

Tags: Auto-Tag, Products, Vendor

Use this task to copy each product's vendor to the product's tag. Optionally, you can apply a prefix to all vendor tags (e.g. "vendor-"). Run this task manually to scan every product in your store. Otherwise, this task will run for specific products, whenever a product is created or updated.

## Documentation

Use this task to copy each product's vendor to the product's tag. Optionally, you can apply a prefix to all vendor tags (e.g. "vendor-"). Run this task manually to scan every product in your store. Otherwise, this task will run for specific products, whenever a product is created or updated.

__Note__: When using the vendor tag prefix option, any tags on a product that contain that prefix, but do not match the current vendor, will be removed. This does _not_ happen when the prefix option is not used or has been changed.
