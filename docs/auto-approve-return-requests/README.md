Use this task to auto-approve return requests, typically made by customers using self-serve from their account. Choose to limit the auto-approval to orders with any of a set of tags, products with any of a set of tags, or specific product categories or types.

**Important:**
- Adding multiple limit conditions means the return request must meet ALL of the conditions in order to be auto-approved.
- More specifically, if any product conditions are configured, then ALL products on the return must meet those conditions.
- Return requests that are auto-approved **cannot** later be used to exchange items.
- Approval of return requests **cannot** be reverted; instead, the return request may be cancelled if needed.
