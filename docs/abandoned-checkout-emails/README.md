## Documentation

Roll your own abandoned checkout emails with this task – or, modify it to perform any other actions that your business needs when a checkout is let go. :) Out of the box, this task sends customers a recovery link, with an emails subject and message that you can easily customize.

This task monitors checkouts in your store, and kicks off an email a day after a checkout is created – if the checkout wasn't completed, and if the customer provided their email address.

To change the followup time from 1 day to something else, click the "Show Advanced" link, and tweak the subscriptions with the time interval that suits your business.

Please note! While the full checkout details are stored, it'll require some custom code to substitute in more details than the checkout recovery URL. Click the "Show Advanced" link in the task editor to dig into the task script, and feel free to message support if you have any questions.
