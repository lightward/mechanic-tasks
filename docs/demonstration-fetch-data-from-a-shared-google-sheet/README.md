## Documentation

This task script demonstrates using the "http" action to retrieve data from a shared Google sheet, using a GET request. It also includes a basic alert email that will be sent to the configured recipients if Mechanic is unable to access the shared sheet as a CSV.

Review the [tutorial for this task](https://learn.mechanic.dev/resources/tutorials/fetching-data-from-a-shared-google-sheet) in the Mechanic docs to see the steps to share your own Google sheet.

Once the data has been successfully retrieved, it will be available in the **mechanic/actions/perform** event topic as an array of hashes, with the CSV column headers as the keys for each entry in the hash.

**Sample Google sheet data:**
```
| SKU    | Quantity |
|--------|----------|
| ABC123 |       10 |
| DEF456 |        0 |
```

**Sample retrieved data:**
```
[
  {
    "SKU": "ABC123",
    "Quantity": "10"
  },
  {
    "SKU": "DEF456",
    "Quantity": "0"
  }
]
```
