## Documentation

After waiting 7 days (or another timespan of your choice), this task attempts to capture all open authorized payments for an order. (Multiple authorizations can exist on edited orders or with post-purchase upsells.)

If the order is modified before capturing, due to applying discounts, changing shipping fees, and/or making item adjustments, then this task will only capture up to a maximum of the current order total. Refunds that are not associated with an item adjustment are not supported by this task.
