## Documentation

Use customer tags to assign staff email addresses to specific customers. When a new order arrives from a customer who has an assignment tag, this task will email the related staff member.

Fill in the "Customer tags and assigned email recipients" option with customer tags on the left (case-insensitive), and staff email addresses on the right. When this task registers a newly-created order with a customer tag that's found in the list, it will send an email to the appropriate email address. If multiple assignment tags are found for the customer, the email will be sent to _all_ related staff members.
