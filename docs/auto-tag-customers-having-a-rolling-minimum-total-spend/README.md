## Documentation

Use this task to tag customers who reach a certain spending threshold, by scanning a rolling period of order history. Useful for rewarding customers who keep a consistent spend total.

Run this task manually to scan all of your customers. **This may take some time!**

This task will also scan all customers on a nightly basis, and will run for a single customer every time a customer's order is paid or cancelled.

Note: By default, Mechanic only scans the last 60 days of order history. To change this, [follow this tutorial](https://help.usemechanic.com/tutorials/enabling-read_all_orders).
