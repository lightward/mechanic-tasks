## Documentation

Use this task to tag orders, as they are created, if every single line item is related to a variant that's in stock.

Enable "Ignore line items not fulfilled manually" to skip line items that you do not fulfill yourself from within Shopify. (This means that orders that consist _entirely_ of these line items will never be tagged by this task.)

Check either of the scheduled run options to have the task scan all unfulfilled, untagged orders on each run to see if they qualify to be tagged.
