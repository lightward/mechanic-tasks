Configure this task with the ID of the product you want to monitor. Find the product ID by opening the product in the Shopify admin, and using the numbers at the very end of the URL in your browser. For example, the product at `https://example.myshopify.com/admin/products/1234567890` would have a product ID of `1234567890`.
