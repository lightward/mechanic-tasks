# Demonstration: Auto-tag new orders, with scheduled reconciliation

Tags: Demonstration, Orders, Tag

This task illustrates Shopify's recommendation of implementing reconciliation, in the case of missing Shopify events. This implementation handles the rare case that Shopify fails to deliver a webhook (orders/create, in this example), by scanning for unprocessed orders every 15 minutes.
