## Documentation

Super simple: this task monitors for order fulfillments, and automatically archives orders when they're fulfilled.

This task runs automatically, when orders are fulfilled. To scan your store's order history and archive all _existing_ fulfilled orders, use the "Run task" button. [Enable "Read all orders"](https://help.usemechanic.com/tutorials/enabling-read_all_orders) to make sure Mechanic can scan your entire order history, and not just the last 60 days.
