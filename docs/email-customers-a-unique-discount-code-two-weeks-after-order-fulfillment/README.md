## Documentation

This task generates a brand new discount code (copying configuration from another code, of your choice), and emails it to the customer, after waiting a configurable number of days after order fulfillment.

Configure this task by first creating a discount code in your store, representative of the discount configuration you'd like this task to use. Provide the task with this source discount's code – when it runs, the task will clone this discount's configuration, using a new and unique discount name.

Configure with a number of days to wait after fulfillment, or remove this value completely to have the discount generated and sent immediately upon fulfillment.

Use the text "DISCOUNT_CODE" to have the generated discount code inserted into your email to the customer, in either the subject or body.
