## Documentation

Use this task to email donation receipts to donors as PDF attachments, with an option to cc the shop email. It runs  on new, paid orders, and it will sum the donation amount from all line items that have a configured product donation tag.

This task can also receive orders sent directly via [admin action links](https://learn.mechanic.dev/core/shopify/admin-action-links#link-usage). When doing so, the task will **not** check that the order is paid to allow for flexibility when sending donation receipts manually.

**Notes:**

- The task comes with a sample donation tag, email subject, email body, donation receipt filename, and donation receipt HTML template. The HTML template is used by the PDF file generator, so care must be taken to provide valid HTML if this field is customized.
- The *[TAX_ID]* and *[DONATION_AMOUNT]* variables need to be present in the HTML template in order for those values to be included in the PDF donation receipt.
- Orders with no donation products will be ignored.
