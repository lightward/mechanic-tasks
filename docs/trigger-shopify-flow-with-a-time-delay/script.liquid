      If you want your Mechanic Flow trigger to be associated
      with a Shopify resource, you may include its numeric ID
      below. Only one resource at a time is supported. Leave
      this out entirely to use the General Mechanic Flow trigger.

      Keep as many of the following as you like. Any omitted
      keys *will* be submitted anyway, using the default value
      given below. If you don't want to use Mechanic's default
      value, make sure to *keep* the key in place below, setting
      it to whatever you like.
