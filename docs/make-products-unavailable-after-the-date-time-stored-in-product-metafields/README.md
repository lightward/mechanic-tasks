## Documentation

Use this task to automatically set product inventory to 0, and the product's inventory policy to deny out-of-stock purchases, after a date/time that you specify in a product metafield.

Configure "Datetime product metafield namespace" and "Datetime product metafield key" with the namespace and key for the product metafield that holds a Shopify [date or date_time](https://shopify.dev/apps/metafields/definitions/types) value. More information on setting up new Shopify metafields can be found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/metafields).

When you run this task (or as it runs hourly/daily, per your configuration), the task will look for products who have a date/time value that's in the past. For qualifying products, all inventory items with a level greater than 0 will have their levels set to exactly 0, and all variants will have their inventory policies set to "deny" (preventing sales, once the variants are all out of stock).

__Note:__ If you choose to use the date only type for the metafield, then the task will receive those dates as midnight local shop time. So, if this task encounters a metafield date that is the same as the task run date, then that metafield date will be in the past based on a seconds-since-midnight calculation.
