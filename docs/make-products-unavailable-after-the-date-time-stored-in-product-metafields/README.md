## Documentation

Use this task to automatically set product inventory to 0, and the product's inventory policy to deny out-of-stock purchases, after a date/time that you specify in a product metafield.

Configure "Datetime product metafield namespace" and "Datetime product metafield key" with the namespace and key for the product metafield that holds a date/time value. Configure "Datetime format" with a valid date/time format, using http://www.strfti.me/ as a guide. This format must _exactly_ match the values you keep in your product metafields. If a value is found that does not match this format, this task will skip that product.

Configuring product metafields requires an app for metafield management. [Metafields Guru](https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-editor-2) is a good choice. :)

When you run this task (or as it runs hourly/daily, per your configuration), the task will look for products who have a date/time value that's in the past. For qualifying products, all inventory items with a level greater than 0 will have their levels set to exactly 0, and all variants will have their inventory policies set to "deny" (preventing sales, once the variants are all out of stock).
