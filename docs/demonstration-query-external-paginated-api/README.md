## Documentation

This task shows how to call an external API using the HTTP action type to first get a limited page of products, and then paginate through the responses until all of the products are fetched.

For this demonstration, the free [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) products resource will be used, which has a pagination method similar to many public REST APIs.

The ```mechanic/actions/perform``` event contains the results from the API. A decision is made based on the pagination data in the results on whether to make an additional API call. For each additional call, an array of fetched products is passed as [meta](https://learn.mechanic.dev/core/tasks/code/action-objects#meta) so they may all be processed at the end of the paginated calls.

**NOTE: Reading the developer docs for an API is a must to understanding how its specific pagination works.**
