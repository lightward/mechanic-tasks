## Documentation

This task is a demonstration of sending text messages via Nexmo. In this task, we monitor for newly-created products, and we send a text message about the product to a phone number stored in that product's metafield.

This task monitors for newly-created products, and sends a text message about the product to a phone number stored in that product's metafield. If there is no number stored, or the number is invalid, no message will be sent.

Notes:

* Nexmo requires all phone numbers to have a country code. If a phone number encountered appears to be an invalid international number, this task will try to add whatever value you've got in the "Default country code" option.
* Your Nexmo information (API key/secret, and SMS phone number) can be found [on the Nexmo dashboard's "Getting started" page](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/getting-started-guide)
* Use test mode to have this task report the message that it _would_ send, if test mode was not enabled
