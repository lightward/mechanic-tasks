## Documentation

Use this task to easily make your inventory levels available in your online storefront theme. This task monitors for changes to inventory, and copies inventory availability figures to metafields on the related variant.

This task runs automatically, whenever an inventory level is adjusted or whenever a variant is stocked for the first time at a new location.

Run this task manually to backfill metafields for all variants that are stocked in the locations you've configured in this task.

"Location IDs and metafield keys" is a [keyval option](https://learn.mechanic.dev/core/tasks/options#flags), where the left-hand side (the _key_) should contain your location IDs, and the right-hand side (the _value_) should contain the "metafield key" that you want to associate with each location (e.g. "1234567890" <> "shop", "2345678901" <> "warehouse").
