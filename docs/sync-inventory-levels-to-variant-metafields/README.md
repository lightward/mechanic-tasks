## Documentation

Use this task to easily make your inventory levels available in your online storefront theme. This task monitors for changes to inventory, and copies inventory availability figures to metafields on the related variant.

This task runs automatically, whenever an inventory level is adjusted or whenever a variant is stocked for the first time at a new location.

Run this task manually to backfill metafields for all variants that are stocked the locations you've connfigured in this task.

Find your location IDs by navigating to Settings > Locations in the Shopify admin area. Then, select an individual location from the list. Its location ID can be found at the very end of the URL in your browser's address bar. For example, the location at this URL:

```
https://example.myshopify.com/admin/locations/1234567890
```

... has a location ID of `1234567890`.

Use this ID on the left-hand side of the "Location IDs and metafield keys" option.
