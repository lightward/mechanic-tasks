## Documentation

This task runs across all active products on your store and syncs a list type product reference metafield to contain all products with a matching common single metafield value (the 'group by' meatfield).

Optionally you can check the 'Remove out of stock products' to have the task remove out of stock products from the product list field on all shared products. * *Note this option is not compatible with products that do not have tracked inventory.*

Example use cases for this task include showing color variations of a product or showing a related products / shop the look section on a product page.

As a working example if you have the following products on your store:
- Cool Black T-Shirt

- Cool Gray T-Shirt

- Cool White T-Shirt

And then you set the 'group by' metafield value on all three to 'Cool T-Shirt', after this task runs on 'Cool Black T-Shirt' it will have the Gray and White products in the product list metafield and so on.  
If you have the 'Include current product' option checked the Black T-Shirt itself will also be included (useful if you want the product list field to stay the same across products when simulating variant options).
