## Documentation

This task demonstrates how a report can be requested from Report Toaster as a PDF. Once delivered, it is emailed to one or more recipients and/or sent to a Slack channel.

You can use this task with any pre-built or custom report from Report Toaster by simply changing the report ID. [Learn how to find your report ID here](https://support.cloudlab.com/portal/en/kb/articles/how-do-i-run-a-report-from-a-mechanic-task).

The report can be requested via CSV or PDF by changing the file format property. If the file format is omitted, the report results are returned as JSON directly within the task result.

See [Mechanic's documentation on Report Toaster](https://learn.mechanic.dev/platform/integrations/report-toaster) for more information.

The task can be run manually, or optionally, set to run as a daily report by checking the "Run this task daily" option. If a less frequent schedule is desired, then you may substitute the "mechanic/scheduler/daily" subscription with a different scheduler topic. See the [Mechanic scheduler event topics](https://learn.mechanic.dev/platform/events/topics#scheduler) for more details.
