## Documentation

Tag orders with the Locksmith secret link used when placing an order. Optionally, tag the customer as well. 

Note: if a customer uses multiple secret links, the last one used is assigned to the order.

This task adds JavaScript to your storefront, which adds ?ls= parameter (Locksmith secret link) to the customer's cart (using the cart attribute name of your choice). (Locksmith secret link values are saved in a browser cookie for one year.) This task copies the cart attribute to the order's tags when the corresponding order is created. Optionally, select to have the value applied to the customer as a tag as well.
