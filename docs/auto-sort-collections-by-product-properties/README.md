# Auto-sort collections by product properties

Tags: Collections, Products, Sort

This task re-sorts your collections by any product property that you choose. A property lookup can be something simple, like "published_at", or more complicated: use multiple property lookups, like "metafields", "store", and "priority", to sort collections by product metafield values.

## Documentation

This task re-sorts your collections by any product property that you choose. A property lookup can be something simple, like "published_at", or more complicated: use multiple property lookups, like "metafields", "store", and "priority", to sort collections by product metafield values.

This task re-sorts your collections by any product property that you choose. Use the "Product property lookups" option to control what attribute the task "looks up". For example, using "published_at" will result in sorting by the date and time the product was published. Add more than one lookup to dive more deeply into product data: using the lookups "metafields", "store", and "priority" will result in a collection sorted by the `store.priority` metafield on each product.
