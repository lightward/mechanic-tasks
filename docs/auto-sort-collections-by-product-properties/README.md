# Auto-sort collections by product properties

Tags: Collections, Products, Sort

This task re-sorts your collections by any product property that you choose. Use the "Product property lookups" option to control what attribute the task "looks up". For example, using "published_at" will result in sorting by the date and time the product was published. Add more than one lookup to dive more deeply into product data: using the lookups "metafields", "store", "priority", and "value" will result in a collection sorted by the `store.priority` metafield value on each product.

Run this task manually to re-sort your collections on demand, or choose to run it hourly or nightly.

This task will scan all collections in the shop on each run, unless you configure it to only sort certain collections using each collection's title or ID. The collections processed by this task must be configured for manual sorting, otherwise they will be ignored.
