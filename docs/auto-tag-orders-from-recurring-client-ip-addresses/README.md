## Documentation

Use this task to regularly scan for repeat orders from a single IP address, by tagging any orders from an IP address that's placed more than a configurable threshold of orders in the last x days of order history.

This task works via manual or scheduled scans of order history - it does not run immediately when orders are created. Instead, whenever it runs, it scans the last x days of order history, tagging orders that come from an IP address whose order count has met or exceeded your threshold.
