## Documentation

Running when a customer is updated, this task will fill empty customer names and/or phones on accounts by pulling the relevant data from any customer addresses on file. Optionally, the task may be run in manual mode to scan and update all customers.

This task is a combination of two separate merchant requests, the first desiring a way to backfill empty customer registration names once initial orders were made, and the second which noted that customer phone numbers were only set when they opted in to receive SMS updates during checkout.

__Note:__ To avoid conflicts with this task running on customer updates (the default configuration), the manual run mode must be toggled by checking the "Enable manual runs to scan all customers" option AND saving the task. This will prevent the task from running on customer updates until this option is unchecked.
