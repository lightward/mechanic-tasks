## Documentation

When an order is created, this task adds the location of the purchase to the customer's tags. Useful for stores with multiple Shopify-powered locations.

This task will run for each new order that's created, applying the order location as a customer tag. Optionally, define a tag to be used for orders that have no physical location.

Run this task manually to have Mechanic scan your entire customer base, and each customer's order history.
