## Documentation

This task monitors for inventory changes, and records the time when a product's inventory falls to 0 or less. Then, on an hourly basis, the task will unpublish any products with a recorded out-of-stock time of at least x days ago.

This task watches for inventory updates. When a product's total inventory becomes 0 or less, the current time will be recorded for that product. Then, on an hourly basis, this task will unpublish any products with a recorded out-of-stock time of at least x days ago.

Notes:

* The first time the hourly scan runs, it may encounter products that were already out of stock, before this task was installed. For those products, the _current_ time will be recorded as their out-of-stock time. This means that these products will wait for another x days before being automatically unpublished.
* If a product that this task unpublishes is manually published, and its total inventory is still 0 or less, this task will unpublish it again during its next hourly scan.
* This task includes a test mode. Enable it to have the task report what it _would_ do, if test mode was disabled.
