Tags: Backups, CSV, Export, FTP

On a configurable schedule, this task generates a Shopify-friendly CSV of your inventory, and uploads it to the SFTP destination of your choice, and/or sends it via email. This is a convenient way to keep regular backups of your entire product inventory: simply import a CSV to restore your inventory to that point in time.

To only export certain products, set the "Only export products matching this query" option to a search query that works with Shopify's inventory admin area. For example, to only export products tagged "backmeup", use the search query "tag:backmeup".
