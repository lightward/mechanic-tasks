## Documentation

This task monitors all variants having a SKU that you configure, and ensures that changes to the available inventory quantity are reflected across all variants sharing that SKU.

First, manually set all available inventory quantities to be equal for each of the SKUs you'd like to monitor. Then manually run this task which will then take a snapshot of the current available inventory quantity for your SKUs. When the task automatically runs, every 10 minutes, it will check for changes to inventory, and ensure that the cumulative change for a SKU is reflected across all product variants sharing that SKU.

**Note:** This task only considers a store's default location when managing inventory.
