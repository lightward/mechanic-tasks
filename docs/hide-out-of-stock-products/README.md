# Hide out-of-stock products

Tags: Inventory, Location, Out of Stock, Products, Unpublish

This task monitors inventory updates, and pulls the product from the configured sales channels whenever a product's total inventory meets your "out of stock" threshold. Optionally, it'll send you an email when it does so. You may also choose whether to further refine the products being considered by this task by configuring inclusion or exclusion tags (note: exclusion tags will always take precedence over inclusion tags).

## Documentation

This task monitors inventory updates, and pulls the product from the configured sales channels whenever a product's total inventory meets your "out of stock" threshold. Optionally, it'll send you an email when it does so. You may also choose whether to further refine the products being considered by this task by configuring inclusion or exclusion tags (note: exclusion tags will always take precedence over inclusion tags).

If you'd like for the task to only count inventory from specific locations, then add the _exact_ location names into the task configuration. This feature can be combined with the tag options for unique unpublishing scenarios.

This task can also be run manually, to scan all products in the shop.
