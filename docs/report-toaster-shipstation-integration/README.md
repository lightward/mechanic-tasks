## Documentation

This task integrates Report Toaster and ShipStation. On order fulfillment, Mechanic calls the ShipStation API to retrieve the shipping cost, and this cost is sent to Report Toaster.

Note - the task currently makes a few assumptions:

1. The task will get all shipping costs for an order once the order is completely fulfilled.
2. The shipping cost is recorded as the shipping cost + insurance cost. You can update the task code to change this logic.
3. ShipStation does not store the "#" with the order name. So the task strips this out.

See your [ShipStation settings](https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api) to retrieve the API Key and Password to use in the task options.

This task can be run manually as a test by entering an order name.

See the [Mechanic documentation for Report Toaster](https://learn.mechanic.dev/platform/integrations/report-toaster) for more information on updating costs.
