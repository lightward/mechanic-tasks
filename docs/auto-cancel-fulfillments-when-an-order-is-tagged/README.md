## Documentation

This task runs when an order is updated. When the tag of your choice is found in the order's tag list, all of its fulfillments (if any) will be cancelled, and the aforementioned tag will be removed.

Notes:

* If the configured tag is added to an order with no fulfillments, the tag _will_ be auto-removed, regardless.
* If an older order happens to be updated, and it already has the configured tag, this task will process the order as if the tag was just added.
