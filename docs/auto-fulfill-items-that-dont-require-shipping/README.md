## Documentation

Useful for digital products, memberships, or anything else that needs to be fulfilled instantly. This task watches for paid (or new) orders, and auto-fulfills all line items that don't require shipping.

Optionally, choose to only process paid orders (default), to wait until other shippable items are fulfilled, and whether to include or exclude products by tag.

**Note:** exclusion tags on a product will take priority over inclusion tags.

This task may also be run manually to process existing open, unfulfilled orders (checking for paid status or other shippable items as configured).
