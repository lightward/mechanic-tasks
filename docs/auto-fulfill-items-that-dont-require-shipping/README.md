## Documentation

Useful for digital products, shipping insurance, gift cards, or anything else that needs to be fulfilled instantly. This task watches for new orders, and auto-fulfills all line items that don't require shipping.

Optionally, choose whether to:
- Only process paid orders
- Wait until other shippable items are fulfilled
- Fulfill gift cards
- Include or exclude products by tag

This task may also be run manually to process existing open, unfulfilled orders.

**Important:**
- Exclusion tags on a product will take priority over inclusion tags
- Shopify has an optional admin setting to auto-fulfill gift cards when orders are paid. Depending on how this task is configured, that setting may need to be turned off to avoid fulfillment conflicts.
