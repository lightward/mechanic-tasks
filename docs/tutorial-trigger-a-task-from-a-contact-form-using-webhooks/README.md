## Documentation

This is a companion task for the Trigger a task from a contact form tutorial: https://learn.mechanic.dev/resources/tutorials/trigger-a-task-from-a-contact-form.

This task is triggered via a webhook which is called when a contact form is submitted on the frontend of your Shopify store. We use the JavaScript for online storefront functionality to insert JavaScript, which listens for a `submit` event, and then posts the form data to your webhook.
