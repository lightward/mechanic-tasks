## Documentation

Use this task to auto-tag customers whose marketing preferences have been updated, adding a tag for those that do accept marketing and removing it from customers who do not. Optionally, choose whether to limit tags to customers who have single or confirmed opt-in levels.

Run this task manually to sync that tag for **ALL** customers that accept marketing (and if checked, with required opt-in level), regardless of their last marketing preference update. Note: If you have many customers, running this task manually could take a long time!
