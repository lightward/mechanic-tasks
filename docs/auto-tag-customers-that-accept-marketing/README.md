## Documentation

Use this task to auto-tag customers whose marketing preferences have been updated, adding a tag for those that do accept marketing and removing it from customers who do not. Optionally, choose whether to limit tags to customers who have single or confirmed opt-in levels. Run this task manually to scan all customers at once.

[Learn more from Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/create-marketing/customer-emails#enable-double-opt-in-for-subscribers) about confirmed opt-in (aka double opt-in), and how to configure this for your store.

Note: Running this task manually will sync that tag for **ALL** customers that accept marketing (and if checked, with required opt-in level), regardless of when their marketing preferences were last updated. If you have many customers, running this task manually could take a long time!
