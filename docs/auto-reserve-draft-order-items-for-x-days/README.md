# Auto-reserve draft order items for X days

Tags: Draft Orders, Products, Reserve

Use this task to auto-reserve all of the line items for a set amount of time on any new or updated draft orders that contain a certain tag. A common use case is when you have an app or service that is creating draft orders on your behalf and you want to make sure that the inventory for those orders is set aside if possible.

## Documentation

Use this task to auto-reserve all of the line items for a set amount of time on any new or updated draft orders that contain a certain tag. A common use case is when you have an app or service that is creating draft orders on your behalf and you want to make sure that the inventory for those orders is set aside if possible.

Configure the task with the "Tag to watch for" and the "Amount of days to reserve". Optionally, enabling the "Preserve the initial reservation date if line items change" will override the default behavior of resetting the reseve until date.

**Important notes:**

- This task does not check the inventory of any line items before reserving them
- Line items can only be reserved at the default location configured in Shopify, since draft orders do not support location assignment
- The one minute delay on the draft order update subscription and the enabled "Perform action runs in sequence" run time option should both be left as configured, to prevent interference with draft order completions and updates
