# Maintain collections by product metafield values

Tags: Bulk, Collections, Metafields, Products

This task will scan your entire catalog to maintain products in collections based on metafield values. Configure the task with a metafield namespace and key (separated by a period, e.g. "custom.color"), and a list of metafield string values paried with collection IDs. If the value of a product's metafield matches any of the configured ones, then the product will be added to that collection. Conversely, products in a configured collection which do not match a metafield value will be removed.

## Documentation

This task will scan your entire catalog to maintain products in collections based on metafield values. Configure the task with a metafield namespace and key (separated by a period, e.g. "custom.color"), and a list of metafield string values paried with collection IDs. If the value of a product's metafield matches any of the configured ones, then the product will be added to that collection. Conversely, products in a configured collection which do not match a metafield value will be removed.

**Note:** This task only checks the values of metafields that are of type *single_line_text_field* or *list.single_line_text_field*. For list type metafields, the product will qualify for collection membership if *any* of the list values matches a metafield value. More information on Shopify metafield types can be found [here](https://shopify.dev/apps/metafields/types#supported-types).
