Run this task manually, and enter one or more order numbers (one per line, making sure to use the exact order number - including symbols and prefixes/suffixes. Mechanic will add the note you configure to the corresponding order, and remove it 12 hours later.

Mechanic will preserve any existing notes on file for these orders, appending the new note content to the end of the content already in place.
