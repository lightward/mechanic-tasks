# Unpublish products from markets when locations are out of stock

Tags: Bulk, Markets, Out of Stock, Products, Unpublish

This task will remove products from markets when they go out of stock at specific locations. It runs on inventory level changes, checking the "available" inventory across all variants for that product and location, and if they are all out of stock it will unpublish the product from the market's publication, thus denying the product from online sale in that market.
