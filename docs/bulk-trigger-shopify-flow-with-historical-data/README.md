## Documentation

Do you wish Shopify Flow workflows could run on historical data? Now they can! :D

This task queries your orders, and calls Shopify Flow for each order returned. You can optionally provide a date range to limit the orders to be processed. If provided, these dates must be in this format *YYYY-MM-DD*.

It includes a flag value, intended to help Flow workflows identify the Mechanic order triggers that are relevant, ignoring those that are not. The flag value _only_ has significance if there are Flow workflows looking for its value, using workflow conditions. A Flow condition for this purpose might read like, _if User string is equal to 'mechanic-import'_.

This task is written to process orders, but can be modified to process products or customers. To make a change like this, open the task code, and update the bulk operation to query for the right resources. Then, update the Flow action to send `product_id` or `customer_id` as appropriate, instead of `order_id`.
