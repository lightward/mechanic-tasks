## Documentation

Use this task to quickly reset product types in bulk based on product titles. When run manually, it will query for all products in the shop and for each product with a matched keyword in the title, the task will assign the paired product type to it.

Configure the product types to set on the left, and the keyword(s) on the right. The task is pre-filled with a sample entry for "Shirts", which can be replaced if not needed.

**Notes:**
- The task will search for keywords in the order of entry in the task configuration, and it will stop once a match is made.
- If a product title does not contain any of the configured keywords, then that product will be ignored.
