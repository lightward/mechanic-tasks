## Documentation

This task watches for product updates, and sends an email for each variant that's found to have a unit cost that's greater than the variant's for-sale price.

This task watches for product updates, and sends an email (to the recipient of your choice) for each variant that's found to have a unit cost that's greater than the variant's for-sale price. It will only send one email per variant, per observed change to variant cost. If a product is updated that the task hasn't had a chance to previously observe, emails will be sent immediately for any variants that have a unit cost greater than their price.
