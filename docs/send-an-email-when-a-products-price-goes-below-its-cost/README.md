This task watches for product updates, and sends an email (to the recipient of your choice) for each variant that's found to have a unit cost that's greater than the variant's for-sale price.

If a product is updated that the task hasn't had a chance to previously observe, emails will be sent immediately for any variants that have a unit cost greater than their price.
