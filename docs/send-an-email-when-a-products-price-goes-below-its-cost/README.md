## Documentation

This task watches for product and inventory item updates, and sends an email to the configured recipients for each variant that's found to have a unit cost that's greater than the variant's for-sale price.

This task stores the known price and cost for each variant in a metafield, so subsequent updates to a product or inventory item will only fire this notification if those values change.

Note: the invetory item update subscription is purposely delayed by 15 seconds to prevent sending a duplicate email when both a variant's price and cost are updated at the same time.
