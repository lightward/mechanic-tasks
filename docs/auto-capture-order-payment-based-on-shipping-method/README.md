## Documentation

This task auto-captures payment if the customer has selected a certain shipping method. Useful for expedited order fulfillments.

To use this task, populate the "Allowed shipping methods" list with shipping method titles (e.g. "Economy"). In Shopify, shipping method titles are configured as "rates"; you can find yours by navigating to Settings > Shipping and delivery, and then looking at the rates within each shipping zone.

For expected results, be sure to enable "Manually capture payment for orders" in Shopify, [using this guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/payment-authorization#set-up-manual-capture-of-credit-card-payments).
