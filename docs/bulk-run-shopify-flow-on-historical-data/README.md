## Documentation

Do you wish Shopify Flow workflows could run on historical data? While they can now! 

This task queries your orders and calls Shopify Flow for each order returned. You can optionally provide a date range to limit the orders to be processed. If provided, these dates must be in this format *YYYY-MM-DD*.

To process Products or Customers, update the bulk operation query in the code and update Mechanic Flow action to send `product_id` or `customer_id`.
