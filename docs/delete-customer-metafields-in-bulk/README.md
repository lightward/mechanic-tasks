# Delete customer metafields in bulk

Tags: Bulk, Customers, Metafields

With no configuration, this task will delete all customer metafields in bulk. Configure it with a metafield namespace to only delete metafields with that namespace, or add both a namespace and key to get even more specific. Run this task with the test mode option enabled, the first time, to make sure you're deleting the right material.
