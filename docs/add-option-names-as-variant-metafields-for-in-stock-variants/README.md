## Documentation

This task populates variant metafields with your desired variant options for use by Online Store 2.0 filtering, taking into account whether or not a variant has inventory available for sale online. It runs when inventory levels are updated, and may also be run manually to scan all variants in your shop.

Configure it with a single metafield namespace (e.g. "my_fields") and one or more variant options (e.g. "Size") paired with their respective metafield key (e.g. "size_in_stock").

__Important:__ To use OS 2.0 collection and search filtering, you must configure variant metafield definitions __prior__ to configuring and enabling this task. Read Shopify's documenation on how to [Add storefront filtering](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes/storefront-filters) for more info.
