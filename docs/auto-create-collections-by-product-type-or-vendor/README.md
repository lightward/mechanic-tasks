# Auto-create collections by product type or vendor

Tags: Collections, Products, Publish, Vendor

When products are created, this task will auto-create smart collections by product type and/or vendor, if such collections don't already exist. Additionally, configuring one or more __exact__ sales channel names will enable publishing of any _newly created_ collections by this task to those sales channels.

## Documentation

When products are created, this task will auto-create smart collections by product type and/or vendor, if such collections don't already exist. Additionally, configuring one or more __exact__ sales channel names will enable publishing of any _newly created_ collections by this task to those sales channels.

_For example:_  
A new product is added with a vendor of "ACME". If a collection with that exact title does not already exist, then the task will create it with a title of "ACME" and add a rule of "vendor = ACME", which will allow Shopify to auto-populate the collection.

The task may also be run manually to gather _all_ of the product types and vendors in your shop, and then making the same decisions on whether to create new collections and publish them.
