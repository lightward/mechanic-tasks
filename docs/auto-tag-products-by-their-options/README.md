Optionally, choose to ignore options that only appear on out-of-stock variants, or choose to apply all tags in lowercase.

Change the separator to change the way tags are built. Using a dash results in "Color-Blue", an underscore results in "Color_Blue", and a colon with a space yields "Color: Blue".
