# Email someone when a certain product is purchased

Tags: Alert, Email, Orders, Products

This task sends an email notification, immediately after an order is paid - if a product in the order has a title matching the product title you configure. Optionally, configure this task with a delay, in days, to wait before sending the email. (The task will not send any emails for orders that have since been cancelled.)
