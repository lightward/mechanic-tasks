## Documentation

Use this task to sell vouchers for future purchases. Buy a product, receive an emailed discount code for a discount on another specific product.

### Getting started

Make sure each of your voucher products has a SKU filled in. This is important: the SKU will be a part of each generated discount code.

In Mechanic, fill in the "Voucher product IDs and entitled product IDs" option with the IDs of the voucher products you're selling on the left, and the IDs of products you want to be discounted on the right.

To find a product ID, open up each product in the Shopify admin, and look at the URL in your browser. The numbers at the very end are your product ID. For example, if this is the URL you're seeing:

```
https://example.myshopify.com/admin/products/1234567890
```

... then your product ID is `1234567890`.

### Background

For the purposes of this task, a "voucher product" is a product you sell to earn a discount to an "entitled product".

This task builds discount coupon codes that are single-use, for a fixed amount of money off a purchase on a specific entitled product.

To make unique discount codes, this task assembles codes using this format:

```
[PREFIX][ORDER NUMBER][VOUCHER SKU][QUANTITY COUNTER][CUSTOMER ID]
```

For example, discount codes might look like:

* `HOORAY1027SIMPLE1806736592949`
* `FLASH381EARLYRISER2914633758241`
* `PRESALE9912EAS135947168211735`
