## Documentation

Email [Pirate Ship](https://www.pirateship.com/) exports to Mechanic and add those shipping costs to orders with Report Toaster.

Did you know your store has its very own email address for triggering Mechanic tasks? A store at example.myshopify.com can receive email at example@mail.usemechanic.com.

One or more attachments can be sent and will be processed as long as they meet the following requirements:

1. The email subject must match the email subject set in the task options.
2. The CSV attachment format matches the order and shipping column names set in the task options.
3. If the order name data does not include the # sign and your shop does, use the prepend pound sign to order name option.

Each attachment will be parsed and sent to Report Toaster.
