## Documentation

Running daily, or manually, this task scans all customers and tags them if their __first__ order was a year or more ago. Alternatively, you may choose to tag customers if their account was created at least a year ago.

Optionally, you may choose whether to wait a certain amount of days before tagging (i.e. a year + X days afterwards), and to configure a "Customer search query" with the same search query you might use in the Shopify admin area. For example:
* Use `tag:VIP` for customers with the VIP tag
* Use `accepts_marketing:true` for customers subscribed to email marketing
* Use `total_spent:>=100` for customers who have spent more than 100 in the local shop currency
