# Demonstration: Trigger a custom event on specific variant changes

Tags: Demonstration, Demonstration, Products, Variants, Watch

This demonstration task responds to product updates, and for each variant of a product it will check to see if the configured attribute matches the stored value. If any of the variant values have changed, then the task will fire the configured custom event, passing along the entire product resource in the same manner as a standard product webhook. This is very useful for creating custom tasks that focus on the busines logic for the problem being solved (e.g. "Send a notification when a product price changes"), without having to continually build the scaffolding of a specific attribute monitor in each.

## Documentation

This demonstration task responds to product updates, and for each variant of a product it will check to see if the configured attribute matches the stored value. If any of the variant values have changed, then the task will fire the configured custom event, passing along the entire product resource in the same manner as a standard product webhook. This is very useful for creating custom tasks that focus on the busines logic for the problem being solved (e.g. "Send a notification when a product price changes"), without having to continually build the scaffolding of a specific attribute monitor in each.

A variant attribute lookup can be something simple, like "price", or more complicated: use multiple attribute lookups, like "metafields", "custom", and "unit_price", and "value" to get a specific variant metafield value. Refer to [Shopify's API documentation](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2023-01/resources/webhook#event-topics-products-update) to find the standard product variant property you want to monitor.

This demonstration task has been preconfigured with price as the variant attribute to monitor, and a custom event topic of "user/product/price_update". Read more about [custom user event topics](https://learn.mechanic.dev/platform/events/topics#user).

**Important**: After configuring this task, run the task manually once to have it store information about each product's existing variant attributes. The custom event will not be fired when a product is first seen by this task.
