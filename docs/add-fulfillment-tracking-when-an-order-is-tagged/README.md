## Documentation

Configure this tag with a mapping of country codes to tracking companies and URL templates, and/or default companies and URL templates. When an order is tagged, this task will apply the appropriate values to each fulfillment that has a tracking number.

Configure this tag with mappings of two-character country codes to tracking companies, and tracking URL templates. Both companies and URL templates support a default value as well, which will be used for orders that don't have a mapped country in the task's configuration. When an order is tagged, this task will apply the appropriate values to each fulfillment that has a tracking number.

If "Notify customers" is enabled, this task will request that Shopify send a notification email when the fulfillment update is processed.
