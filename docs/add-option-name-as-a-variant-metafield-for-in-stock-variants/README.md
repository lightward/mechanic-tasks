# Add Option Name as a Variant Metafield for In Stock Variants

Tags: (not tagged!)

This task was originally designed to power a "Size in Stock" filter in Online Store 2.0 filtering. It could equally be configured for "Colour in Stock" or any other option name from where you want to use the values in a filter.
2.0 filtering does include an In Stock and Size filter by default, but the combination is unintuitive.
