# Sync in stock locations to a variant metafield

Tags: (not tagged!)

This task will maintain a variant list metafield of in stock location names. Running on a schedule, it will check recently updated variants to see which are in stock at each location. Variants with positive "available" inventory at a location, or are configured for overselling, are considered to be in stock, as are variants that are sold from a location but not tracked.

## Documentation

This task will maintain a variant list metafield of in stock location names. Running on a schedule, it will check recently updated variants to see which are in stock at each location. Variants with positive "available" inventory at a location, or are configured for overselling, are considered to be in stock, as are variants that are sold from a location but not tracked.

Optionally, you may choose to have this task only check specific locations using the "Include location names" option, or to ignore specific locations using the "Exclude location names" option. Exclusions will only apply if the inclusions field is empty.

Run the task manually to scan all variants (up to 25K) in the shop for initial setup.

**Important:** if you wish the configured variant metafield to be used as a search filter on your website using [Shopify Search & Discovery](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/search-and-discovery), then you must set up a [custom metafield definition](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields/metafield-definitions/creating-custom-metafield-definitions) for it *before* running this task. Otherwise, you will not be able to create the metafield definition with a "list.single_line_text_field" type.
