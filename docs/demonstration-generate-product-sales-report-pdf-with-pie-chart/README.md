## Documentation

This task demonstrates how a product sales report can be generated as PDF and emailed to one or more recipients. It also shows how charts can be embedded in the PDF report using a 3rd party library like [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).

By default, the report will generate sales data by product. You may also choose to have the report group sales by product type or vendor. Each group type will generate a single pie chart showing the top 10 products (or types/vendors) by total sales in the selected reporting period.

For the sales reporting period, select _only_ one of the following options:
- Report on sales from today
- Report on sales from yesterday
- Report on sales in the past week
- Report on sales in the past month
- Report on sales in the past quarter
- Report on sales in the past year

The task can be run manually, or optionally, set to run as a daily report by checking the “Run this task daily” option. If a less frequent schedule is desired, then you may modify the __mechanic/scheduler/daily__ subscription to another frequency. See the [scheduler](https://learn.mechanic.dev/platform/events/topics#scheduler) section in the docs for more details.

Note: For shops with a high frequency of orders and/or a very large product catalog, these PDF reports can generate a large amount of pages. Consequently, this task should be considered a starting point to develop reporting tasks that work for your shop’s unique requirements.
