# Auto-update inventory policy based on a "preorder" tag

Tags: Auto-Update, Products, Tag, Watch

This task scans your product catalog nightly or when you hit the "Run task" button, checking for the presence of a "preorder" tag, or a tag that starts with "preorder_" (like "preorder_summer"). If this tag is found, the task updates the product to allow customers to purchase the product after it's out of stock. If no preorder tag is found, the task makes sure customers *cannot* purchase the product if it's out of stock.

## Documentation

This task scans your product catalog nightly or when you hit the "Run task" button, checking for the presence of a "preorder" tag, or a tag that starts with "preorder_" (like "preorder_summer"). If this tag is found, the task updates the product to allow customers to purchase the product after it's out of stock. If no preorder tag is found, the task makes sure customers *cannot* purchase the product if it's out of stock.

Optionally, choose whether to "Run on product create and update instead of daily", which includes events such as product tagging, inventory level adjustments, and inventory policy changes.

Notes:

* For efficiency, this task only scans _published_ products in your catalog.
