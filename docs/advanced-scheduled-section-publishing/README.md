This advanced task allows you to schedule section publishing and unpublishing for your store. To use this task, enter a datetime to publish, a theme ID, and template names paired with one or more section IDs to publish or unpublish. If the configured datetime matches the current task run time at a scheduled 10 minute interval, then it will publish and/or unpublish the theme sections as configured.

## Documentation

This advanced task allows you to schedule section publishing and unpublishing for your store. To use this task, enter a datetime to publish, a theme ID, and template names paired with one or more section IDs to publish or unpublish. If the configured datetime matches the current task run time at a scheduled 10 minute interval, then it will publish and/or unpublish the theme sections as configured.

__Important Notes:__
- The datetime to publish must be in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" with a 24 hour clock time having minutes that are a multiple of 10, since that is the smallest scheduler interval available.
- Template names should be entered without the _.json_ suffix (e.g. index, page.contact).
- Template names can appear in both the publish and unpublish keyval configurations, but they may only appear once in each since they are the left-hand keys.
- Section IDs should be entered in the right-hand value fields, paired with their respective template.
- Multiple section IDs being (un)published for the same template must be  entered on multiple lines of the same entry field.

_Example configuration_
- Datetime to publish: __2022-07-31 13:30__
- Theme ID: __1234567890__
- Template names and section IDs to publish:
  - __index__
    - _collage_
    - _123456abcdef_
- Template names and section IDs to unpublish:
  - __index__
    - _234561bcdefa_
