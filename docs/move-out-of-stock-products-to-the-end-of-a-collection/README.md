## Documentation

This task re-sorts your collections, beginning with the sort order of your choice (alphabetically, best selling first, etc), and then moving all out-of-stock products to the very end of the collection.

Run this task manually to re-sort your collections on demand. Optionally, configure this task to run hourly or nightly as well.

Configure this task for certain collections using each collection's title, or its ID. [Learn how to find the collection IDs.](https://help.usemechanic.com/en/articles/2946120-how-do-i-find-an-id-for-a-product-collection-order-or-something-else)

You may use any of these options for the base sort order:

* MANUAL
* BEST_SELLING
* ALPHA_ASC
* ALPHA_DESC
* PRICE_DESC
* PRICE_ASC
* CREATED_DESC
* CREATED

__Note__: To function correctly, the "Perform action runs in sequence" option should stay enabled in the task's advanced settings.
