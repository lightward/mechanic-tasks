## Documentation

Use this this task to monitor for the addition of a new customer tag, and to schedule the customer to be untagged some number of days later. Useful for granting temporary access to discounts, or other resources.

This task monitors new and updated customers, watching for the configured customer tag.

As soon as that tag is detected, the task will _add_ a second tag, indicating that the customer is scheduled to be untagged. (For example, if the task is configured to watch for the tag "Approved", the task will _add_ the tag "Approved - will be auto-removed by Mechanic".) The task will then schedule a followup event for the future, according to the configured number of days to wait. At that time, the task will remove both tags.

Important note: To _prevent_ the task from untagging the customer later, manually remove the task's additional tag (i.e. the "will be auto-removed by Mechanic" tag). If the additional tag is found missing, the task will leave the tag in place instead of auto-removing it.
