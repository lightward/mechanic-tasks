Please note: this task works by *sales channel*, and as such does not apply to orders that are created by an *app*. It's sometimes difficult to distinguish whether a third-party is using a sales channel or an app; if you're having trouble with this task, try its companion, [Auto-tag orders by app](https://usemechanic.com/task/auto-tag-orders-by-app).
