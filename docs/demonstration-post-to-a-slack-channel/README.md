# Demonstration: Post to a Slack channel

This task posts a demonstration message in the Slack channel of your choice. Try it out to learn how the Slack action works!

## Quick Start

1. Install the Mechanic Slack app in your Slack workspace (Settings â†’ Authentication â†’ Slack)
3. Set two task options:
    - Your Slack account
    - The Slack channel ID to post to
      - If this is a private channel, then you must add the Mechanic bot to the channel before it can post messages
4. Run the task

Look in your Slack channel for the demonstration message. (Although you'll likely get a combination of app, email, and web notifications for this one post ðŸ˜‚)

## Want to Learn More?

This task demonstrates how to:
- Create a new message in an Slack channel
- Build dynamic message structure with some common Slack block kit components: header, section, divider, button
