## Documentation

This task runs immediately after an order is created, and captures any authorized transactions. Choose which risk levels to capture for, and optionally choose to filter by order tag.

If you have additional apps or tasks informing an order's risk level, increase the "Minutes to wait before capturing" to make sure they have time to contribute their data.
