# Partially auto-capture payments as orders are fulfilled

Tags: Fulfillment, Orders, Payment

Running when an order is updated, this task captures payment in proportion to the order value that has been fulfilled. For example, for an order with a subtotal of $10 and a total of $15 with shipping/taxes/discounts, this task will capture $7.50 when $5 of the order's value has been fulfilled.
