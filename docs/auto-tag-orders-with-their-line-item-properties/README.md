## Documentation

Use this task to tag incoming orders with all of the line item properties found on the order. Optionally, configure a list of property names to be included, or a list of property names to be excluded. This task can also be run manually to scan and tag historical orders.

Change the "Property name and value separator" to change the way tags are built. Using a dash results in "Name-Value", an underscore results in "Name_Value", and a colon with a space yields "Name: Value". The task preview conveniently shows what a sample tag combo will look like.

Notes:
- Configuring any property names to include means the task will ignore the property names to exclude setting entirely.
- Because line item properties cannot change after order creation, this task does not remove any tags from orders.
- Shopify limits order tags to 40 characters in length. If a tag combo exceeds this limit it will not be set on the order.
