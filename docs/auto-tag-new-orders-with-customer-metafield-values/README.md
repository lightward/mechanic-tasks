## Documentation

When new orders are created, this task will check to see if any of the configured metafields are set on the customer who placed the order, and if so then it will add order tags based on the metafield values.

Configure this task by adding customer metafields on the left, in the form of *namespace.key*, and the optional paired tag prefixes on the right. Prefixes should include a divider and/or spacing as needed (e.g. "Batch: ", "attn_").

This task supports the following metafield types - "boolean", "date", "date_time", "number_decimal", "number_integer", and "single_line_text_field". List versions of each type are also supported (e.g. "list.single_line_text_field"). List metafields with multiple values set on the customer will result in an order tag being added for each value.

**IMPORTANT:** Shopify limits order tags to 40 characters. If a tag (including the optional prefix) exceeds that length, then that tag will not be set on the order. Enable the "Truncate long tags" option to have the task truncate tags to a maximum of 40 characters. Truncations are made from the right side of the tag.
